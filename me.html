                    Over the summer of 2017/2018 I was working as a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://orionhealth.com/nz/">Orion Health</a> in the Rhapsody team. The project I worked on is now open source on <a href="https://github.com/orionhealth/rlc-analyser">GitHub</a>. Its a sweet little Java application that displays the information stored inside an RLC file in a nice format. Designed for Rhapsody users.

                      Learning languages - As a youngling, I grew up learning three different languages; English (from my Dad), Thai (from my Mum) and Chinese/Mandarin (from school). Sadly, I lost most of my Thai when I moved to New Zealand. Now, I am picking up Thai again as well as learning Korean and Japanese when I get the time.

                      As kid I was fortunately enough to have lived and experienced different countries and cultures. I was born in Singapore and lived there for 8 years. Then we moved to Christchurch, New Zealand, where I spent the rest of my primary school and high school days. In this time, I was able to explore Thailand, Cambodia, Fiji, China and Australia.

                    I don't play a lot due to other commitments but I do enjoy: <a href="https://stardewvalley.net/">Stardew Valley</a> and Civilisation V. Occasionally, I will brush the dust off my 3DS and play some Animal Crossing: New Leaf or Professor Layton.
